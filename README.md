This game starts by displaying the rules of battleship randomly places the players ships or allows the player to manually place ships. The player and pc take turns trying to hit the other's battleships with sunken battleships and the board being displayed for each turn.

# Three Files Are Required:
battleship.h: contains function declarations for functions defined in battleship.c.

battleship.c: contains function definitions for functions defined in battleship.h.

main.c: contains the main function for the battleship game played in the terminal.

# Possible Improvements

instructions for entering coordinates should be clearer.

The game could be improved by creating an option for two human players instead of one player vs the pc.
